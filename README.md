# Keycloakify Starter

This repo constitutes an easily reusable setup for a Keycloak theme project.
This starter is based on Vite. There is also [a Webpack based starter](https://github.com/keycloakify/keycloakify-starter-cra).  


# Quick start

```bash
git https://github.com/henry-azer/keycloakify-starter

cd keycloakify-starter

npm i # install dependencies (it's like npm install)

npm run storybook # Start Storybook
                  # This is by far the best way to develop your theme
                  # This enable to quickly see your pages in isolation and in different states.  
                  #Â You can create stories even for pages that you haven't explicitly overloaded. See src/keycloak-theme/login/pages/LoginResetPassword.stories.tsx
                  # See Keycloakify's storybook for if you need a starting point for your stories: https://github.com/keycloakify/keycloakify/tree/main/stories

npm run dev # See the Hello World app
            # Uncomment line 97 of src/keycloak-theme/login/kcContext where it reads: `mockPageId: "login.ftl"`, reload https://localhost:3000
            # You can now see the login.ftl page with the mock data. (Don't forget to comment it back when you're done)
          
# Install mvn (Maven) if not already done. On mac it's 'brew install maven', on Ubuntu/Debian it's 'sudo apt-get install maven'

npm run build-keycloak-theme # Actually build the theme (generates the .jar to be imported in Keycloak)
                             # Read the instruction printed on the console to see how to test
                             # your theme on a real Keycloak instance.

npx eject-keycloak-page # Prompt that let you select the pages you want to customize
                        # This CLI tools is not guaranty to work, you can always copy pase pages 
                        # from the Keycloakify repo.
                        # After you ejected a page you need to edit the src/keycloak-theme/login(or admin)/KcApp.tsx file
                        # You need to add a case in the switch for the page you just imported in your project.  
                        # Look how it's done for the Login page and replicate for your new page.  

npx initialize-email-theme # For initializing your email theme
                           # Note that Keycloakify does not feature React integration for email yet.

npx download-builtin-keycloak-theme # For downloading the default theme (as a reference)
                                    # Look for the files in dist_keycloak/src/main/resources/theme/{base,keycloak}
```

# Theme variant  

Keycloakify enables you to create different variant for a single theme.  
This enable you to have a single jar that embed two or more theme variant.  

![Theme variant](https://content.gitbook.com/content/FcBKODbZbNDgm0rc6a9K/blobs/9iKgs2rv2Kfb2pbs4dRz/image.png)  

You can enable this feature by providing multiple theme name in the Keycloakify build option.  
[See documentation](https://docs.keycloakify.dev/build-options#themename)  

# The CI workflow

-   To release **don't create a tag manually**, the CI do it for you. Just update the `package.json`'s version field and push.
-   The `.jar` files that bundle the Keycloak theme will be attached as an asset with every GitHub release. [Example](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/keycloakify-starter/releases/tag/v0.1.0). The permalink to download the latest version is: `https://github.com/USER/PROJECT/releases/latest/download/keycloak-theme.jar`.
